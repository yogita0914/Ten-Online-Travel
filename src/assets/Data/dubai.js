After driving into the Palm Jumeirah, known as the eighth wonder of the world, we pause for a short picture op in front of the Atlantis Hotel to start our tour. Next, following the tradition of Egypt's Fatimi mosques, we drive to the stunning Jumeirah Mosque, which was constructed in 1979. In order to have a long-distance perspective of the world's tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa Tower, our group is traveling towards the well-known Sheikh Zayed road expressway. On our route to the well-known Dubai Creek, we continue our journey through the city's historic district, passing the magnificent mansions of Dubai's royal family. After that, our guide guides us.",

As the charcoal fires and the traditional oven are lighted in preparation for our evening meal, our visitors are greeted in the traditional manner with Arabic coffee, tea, and dates. Spend some time unwinding by the campfire or in our Arabic tents, which are equipped with cushions and carpets for your pleasure. Enjoy a memorable camel ride or get a henna tattoo while we wait for the highlight of the evening, which features a unique belly dance performance set to the rhythmic pulse of Arabia and a Tanoura dance display. A delectable three-course barbecue dinner including a range of meats and salads is served outside under the stars as real Arabic music plays as our evening comes to a close. We take a car back to the city after supper.",
